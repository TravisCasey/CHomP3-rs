# CHomP3-rs
**C**omputational **Hom**ology **P**roject 3 is a crate designed to efficiently compute the homology of topological spaces whose size or complexity may preclude standard computational methods or libraries.

This project is inspired by and partially built off previous iterations of CHomP. See the [NOTICE](./NOTICE) for attribution.
